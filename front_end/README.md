# What's in this template?

This is an opinionated tempate for React projects that use `styled-components`.

The initial folder structure also has folders like `_helpers` and `_constants` for quick access to things like colors and checking for viewport width. There is also a `jsconfig.json` to allow for relative pathing directly from `src`.

`eslint` is configured, and `husky` checks code formatting before allowing pushes to a branch.

Simply clone the repo and run `npm i` to get started.
